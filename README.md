## General Information

Here you will find a simple (like always minimal :)) text data augmentation framework written in Python to use in your ML/DL projects.

I created this framework over the night in summer of 2024 as part of the
course "Computer Science Seminar".
It uses the sprintf and a two dimensional array as a buffer to display the test results.
I called it **synthetixt**. **synthetixt** is a partial blend (**Synthetic** + **Text**)
Feel free to extend/adjust this project so that it meets your goals.
